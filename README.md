### JVC Android Remote for X900/X700/X500 series
This is a scrappy android remote for the projector connected to a local area network, controlling via TCP commands. 
On first time setup user will typically have to set up their ports and IP. The manual can be found online.
This port configuration is the same for if you use the JVC Projector Calibration over LAN.
